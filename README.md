# Sourcer

Sourcer is a Go-based annotation-driven code generator designed to simplify repetitive coding tasks by using annotations directly in your source code. It can automate common patterns in development by generating code based on pre-defined annotations.

## Features
- Annotation-based code generation.
- Supports Go language projects.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate.

## Usage

Add your annotations in the Go code and run Sourcer to generate the necessary boilerplate.

## Notes

I will try to add more information and examples of use in my free time
